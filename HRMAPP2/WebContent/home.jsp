	<p>A product is the item offered for sale. A product can be a
		service or an item. It can be physical or in virtual or cyber form.
		Every product is made at a cost and each is sold at a price. The price
		that can be charged depends on the market, the quality, the marketing
		and the segment that is targeted. Each product has a useful life after
		which it needs replacement, and a life cycle after which it has to be
		re-invented. In FMCG parlance, a brand can be revamped, re-launched or
		extended to make it more relevant to the segment and times, often
		keeping the product almost the same. Description: A product needs to
		be relevant: the users must have an immediate use for it. A product
		needs to be functionally able to do what it is supposed to, and do it
		with a good quality. A product needs to be communicated: Users and
		potential users must know why they need to use it, what benefits they
		can derive from it, and what it does difference it does to their
		lives. Advertising and 'brand building' best do this. A product needs
		a name: a name that people remember and relate to. A product with a
		name becomes a brand. It helps it stand out from the clutter of
		products and names. A product should be adaptable: with trends, time
		and change in segments, the product should lend itself to adaptation
		to make it more relevant and maintain its revenue stream.</p>
